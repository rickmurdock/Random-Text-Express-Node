# Random-Text-Express-Node
The Iron Yard Daily Project: Generate random text with Express and Node

Read [The Art of Node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node) up through "Modules and npm."

Install the Node package [lorem-ipsum](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lorem-ipsum) via `npm`. This package generates ["lorem ipsum" text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum), which is often used as filler for content that is not yet written.

Create an Express app that responds on the URL `/lorem` by returning three paragraphs of text in HTML format generated by the `lorem-ipsum` package.

**Hard Mode**
Add the ability to accept URLs with the structure `/lorem/[number-of-paragraphs]`, where `[number-of-paragraphs]` is a positive integer that determines how many paragraphs of lorem ipsum text to generate.
